# Videogame_PIC18F4550
This is a final project that consists in a simple videogame using C language in order to be run in the microcontroller PIC18F4550. This project involucres an audio and graphic logic.

The game was designed through a potentiometer that controls the position of our character: a spaceship. The user can move it between the two lines of the display and the objective will be to interact with the proposed scenario in which it consists of a series of obstacles / enemies that when you collide with one of them will lower points by a factor that depends on each one of the 6 levels that exist and of which the speed of the game increases as well as the background music.
